Egyptian identity evolved in the span of a long period of occupation to accommodate Islam , Christianity and Judaism ; and a new language , Arabic , and its spoken descendant , Egyptian Arabic which is also based on many Ancient Egyptian words .
The work of early 19th century scholar Rifa'a al-Tahtawi renewed interest in Egyptian antiquity and exposed Egyptian society to Enlightenment principles . Tahtawi co-founded with education reformer Ali Mubarak a native Egyptology school that looked for inspiration to medieval Egyptian scholars , such as Suyuti and Maqrizi , who themselves studied the history , language and antiquities of Egypt .
