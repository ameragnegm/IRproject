Egypt is a recognised cultural trendsetter of the Arabic-speaking world.Contemporary Arabic and Middle-Eastern culture is heavily influenced by Egyptian literature, music , film and television . Egypt gained a regional leadership role during the 1950s and 1960s , giving a further enduring boost to the standing of Egyptian culture in the Arabic-speaking world .Al-Azhar Park is listed as one of the world's sixty great public spaces by the Project for Public Spaces .Egyptian identity evolved in the span of a long period of occupation to accommodate Islam , Christianity and Judaism ; and a new language , Arabic , and its spoken descendant , Egyptian Arabic which is also based on many Ancient Egyptian words .The work of early 19th century scholar Rifa'a al-Tahtawi renewed interest in Egyptian antiquity and exposed Egyptian society to Enlightenment principles . Tahtawi co-founded with education reformer Ali Mubarak a native Egyptology school that looked for inspiration to medieval Egyptian scholars , such as Suyuti and Maqrizi , who themselves studied the history , language and antiquities of Egypt .Egypt's renaissance peaked in the late 19th and early 20th centuries through the work of people like Muhammad Abduh , Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed , Muhammad Loutfi Goumah , Tawfiq el-Hakim , Louis Awad , Qasim Amin , Salama Moussa , Taha Hussein and Mahmoud Mokhtar . They forged a liberal path for Egypt expressed as a commitment to personal freedom , secularism and faith in science to bring progress .
