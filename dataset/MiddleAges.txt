the byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief sasanid persian invasion early in the 7th century amidst the byzantine–sasanian war of 602–628 during which they established a new short-lived province for ten years known as sasanian egypt, until 639–42, when egypt was invaded and conquered by the islamic caliphate by the muslim arabs. when they defeated the byzantine armies in egypt, the arabs brought islam to the country. some time during this period, egyptians began to blend in their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices, leading to various sufi orders that have flourished to this day.[47] these earlier rites had survived the period of coptic christianity.[49]
in 639 an army were sent in egypt by the second caliph, umar, under the command of amr ibn al-as. they defeated a roman army at the battle of heliopolis. amr next proceeded in the direction of alexandria, which surrendered to him by a treaty signed on 8 november 641. alexandria was regained for the byzantine empire in 645 but was retaken by amr in 646. in 654 an invasion fleet sent by constans ii was repulsed.
the arabs founded the capital of egypt called fustat, which was later burned down during the crusades. cairo was later built in the year 986 to grow to become the largest and richest city in the arab caliphate, second only to baghdad.
in 1906, the denshawai incident prompted many neutral egyptians to join the nationalist movement.
